## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I decided to make this project in less than a day to practice a little bit of React.

### Continued development

I want to continue practicing React and learn more about it, now I'm planning to make a project with React Hooks.

### Useful resources

- [BEM Cheat Sheet](https://9elements.com/bem-cheat-sheet/) - This helped me to keep an order in Semantic HTML. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
